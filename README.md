# proportional_multiple_resonant_design

A code to compute proportional_multiple_resonant (PMR) controller and current feedback gain in order to ensure UPS stability and performance. PMR and current gains tunned by means of pole placement. Output to linear and non-linear load are plotted without the need for graphical environment circuits, which makes it simple and light for learning and practical design applications.
